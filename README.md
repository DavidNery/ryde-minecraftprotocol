This is a "minilauncher" for minecraft Java Edition.

This not render chunks, only chat and other things smaller, like scoreboard.

<strong>ATTENTION:</strong> this project was not designed to be used by ordinary users. 
Its purpose is to help developers test plugins for minecraft servers.
So, when you need to test plugins that require more than one client and that donâ€™t necessarily need chunks rendering, this project is a good option.

## What you can do with it?
For now, the only things that you can do are:
- Send ping
- Connect / disconnect
- Send and receive chat messages

Yes, I plan to add support for more things.
